							<p>
								A really cool simulation that I wanted to implement. The idea is to simulate a pool of
								two kinds chemicals, A and B, which react according to the chemical equation 2B + A
								&rarr; 3B and gradually diffuse at different rates. In addition, chemical A is
								constantly added and chemical B is constantly removed. The simulation does not track
								individual molecules; instead, it tracks the <em>concentration</em> of A and B at each
								point and updates them according to the differential equations governing the reaction
								and the diffusion. With an appropriate choice of parameters, the simulation can display
								surprisingly complex behavior that looks almost biological. I had to recall my AP
								Chemistry knowledge to get the differential equations right for updating the simulation.

							<h3>Untitled BGM</h3>
							<p>
								I was experimenting with unusual modes and time signatures and this came out. I tried
								making it work for a game I was developing, but it didn't work out.

							<h3>Journey</h3>

								This is the result.

							<h3>Fugue in G minor</h3>
							<p>
								A fugue for 3 clarinets, in G minor. This is my first attempt at writing a contrapuntal
								piece; I think I did reasonably well.

							<h3>The enchanted forest</h3>
							<p>
								An otherworldly-sounding piece. I really like the middle section in the Phrygian mode.
								This was submitted for an AP Music Theory assignment on using the church modes.

								did, also for an AP Music Theory assignment.

							<h3>Abandoned Circus</h3>

								A short 8-bar composition I came up with. For some reason, it gave me dark, circus
								vibes.
