					<p>
						I'm a high school student from Seven Lakes High School who enjoys coding in their free time. In
						addition to making a large quantity of weird and interesting projects (mostly games or tools or

						music.

					<h2> Coding Experience </h2>
					<p>
						I have been programing in Python for 8 years, Java for 6 years, HTML/CSS/JS for 5 years, and C++
						for 5 years. In addition, I have a little bit of experience with C#, MATLAB, and a few other
						languages. I am currently learning Rust. <a href="./#scrollto=projects">Check out some of

							<p>
								A really cool simulation that I wanted to implement. The idea is to simulate a pool of
								two kinds chemicals, A and B, which react according to the chemical equation 2B + A
								&rarr; 3B and gradually diffuse at different rates. In addition, chemical A is
								constantly added and chemical B is constantly removed. The simulation does not track
								individual molecules; instead, it tracks the <em>concentration</em> of A and B at each
								point and updates them according to the differential equations governing the reaction
								and the diffusion. With an appropriate choice of parameters, the simulation can display
								surprisingly complex behavior that looks almost biological. I had to recall my AP
								Chemistry knowledge to get the differential equations right for updating the simulation.
							</p>
							<img class="project-img" src="res/images/rds-0.png" alt="Sorry, the image didn't load :(">
							<span class="project-img-caption">
								The simulation run with diffusion radius = 1, relative diffusion rate = 0.5, feed rate =

							<h3>The enchanted forest</h3>
							<p>
								An otherworldly-sounding piece. I really like the middle section in the Phrygian mode.
								This was submitted for an AP Music Theory assignment on using the church modes.

							<h3>Epilogue</h3>
							<p>
								I imagine this might be a sad ending to a movie? This was an exercise in voice-leading I

								I sat down one day and wanted to write something happy to make me not sad. This is the
